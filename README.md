This is my first review at Makers.

## Challenge

Make an application that organises grades in the order 'Green, Amber, Red'. It should be displayed with the amount of each result first followed by all the scores. If 'Red, Green, Amber' was given as an argument it would print the console like this:
"Green: 1 Amber: 1 Red: 1"
"Green"
"Amber"
"Red"
